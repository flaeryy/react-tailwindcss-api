          The Victorian Health Promotion Foundation (VicHealth) is a pioneer in
          health promotion - the process of enabling people to increase control
          over and improve their health. Our primary focus is promoting good
          health and preventing chronic disease. We create and fund world-class
          interventions. We conduct vital research to advance Victoria's
          population health. We produce and support public campaigns to promote
          a healthier Victoria. We provide transformational expertise and
          insights to government. Of all the things we do, above all we seek to
          make health gains among Victorians by pre-empting and targeting
          improvements in health across our population, fostered within the
          day-to-day spaces where people spend their time, and with benefits to
          be enjoyed by all.

        <p>
          Strong working relationships with stakeholders are vital to ensure
          VicHealth can help Victorians live healthier, happier lives and that
          together we can support stakeholders to achieve our shared health
          promotion aims. VicHealth's Stakeholder Engagement Framework guides
          how we work with stakeholders, to both deliver on the VicHealth Action
          Agenda for Health Promotion, and support the health promotion goals of
          our partners. The Framework outlines our commitment to open,
          collaborative, inclusive, respectful and meaningful engagement with
          our stakeholders. These key principles will guide our work and ensure
          we cultivate consistent, strong and effective relationships. A range
          of stakeholder feedback has informed and enhanced this Framework and
          our approach. To ensure we are delivering effectively against the
          Framework, we will be routinely reviewing our progress against the
          principles and objectives outlined.

        <p>
          Pinpointing and preventing the negative influences of ill health, and
          championing the positive influences on good health, is central and
          exclusive to our work. Our priorities support government objectives
          and relevant aspects of the Victorian Department of Healthâ€™s Public
          Health and Wellbeing Plan.
